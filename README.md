# OS_Ex4

HOW TO USE:

1. Open a terminal in the folder
2. Write in the terminal "make all"
    It will compile both the server and the client.
3. Run the server by writing "./server" in the terminal
4. For each client you want to run you will need a different terminal

    After you are in a different terminal from the server,
    write "./client localhost" in the terminal
5. Now you are free to use the 3 functions for a stack - "PUSH", "POP", "TOP"

    PUSH - write "PUSH *" where the * is the string you want to push

    POP -  write "POP"

    TOP - write "TOP"
6. To close the client write "EXIT"
